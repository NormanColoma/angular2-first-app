# Angular2-First-App

The proposal of this project is to start from the scratch an application based on [Angular 2](https://angular.io/), following the official [Style Guide](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/style-guide.html).

The application consists in a simple list of Writers, where you can read a few description about them, and list some of their
most known books. At the initial state, I don't care about the UI, I want to focus in Angular 2.This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

Feel free to ask for a pull request if you want to contribute to this project and get some practice in Angular 2.

## API  

This project is fetching the data from the following API: [Writers API](https://github.com/NormanColoma/writers-backend). You need to run both the APP and the API at the same time, otherwise you won't be loading no data, unless you modify the project.


## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/route/class`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

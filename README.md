# Angular2-First-App: Writers App

The proposal of this project is to start from the scratch an application based on [Angular 2](https://angular.io/), following the official [Style Guide](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/style-guide.html).

The application consists in a simple list of Writers, where you can read a few description about them, and list some of their most known books.This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

Feel free to ask for a pull request if you want to contribute to this project and get some practice in Angular 2.

## Setup and Install

Just clone this repo or download the .zip directly.

### Dependencies

Before running the app, you will need to install some dependencies of which run on Node.js. For setting up everything
correctly, just follow the steps below:

1. Download and install [Node.js here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
2. Install [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/)
3. Once you cloned the repo, move into the directory and run the following command:

> **Command:** npm install

### Backend Data

Since the project is fetching the data from external simple API and interacting with it, you can either, clone it or modify the project and make use of your own API or simply mock the data.

You can find the [API here](https://github.com/NormanColoma/writers-backend). Also you will find the instructions for install and run the API in the link above. The API is as simple as the purpose of
this application.

## Running application locally

Simply run the following command:

> **Command:** npm start

After a while if you look at the console you should see a message saying:

> Serving on http://localhost:4200/

Launch the application from a browser, and we're done!

## About the application

Application is still growing and as I told at the beginning, is very simple APP through which we can practice and initiate to Angular 2. Because of that, there are neither E2E Test and Unit Test implemented (although I'm planning to incorporate them as soon as possible).

Besides, I stylised a little bit (it's awful I know) the application, but actually it isn't the main purpose.
